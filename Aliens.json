    "overview": "Humans (Homo sapiens), sometimes referred to as “Terrans,” are a warp-capable humanoid species from Earth in the Sol system. After Earth’s 21st‑century conflicts, Humanity’s recovery and rapid technological growth culminated in the Phoenix’s first warp flight and historic first contact with Vulcans in 2063. In the 22nd century, Earth unified under a single planetary authority (United Earth), expanded through exploration and settlement, and became a driving force behind the interstellar cooperation that led to the United Federation of Planets—founded on Earth in 2161.",
    "biology": "Humans are warm‑blooded, bilaterally symmetrical, bipedal primates with two hands and two feet, each typically having five digits. By the 22nd century, average Human lifespan had extended to roughly a century, and by the mid‑24th century it was common for Humans to live to 120+; Dr. Leonard McCoy is noted as having lived to at least 137. Humans are generally not as physically strong as some species (e.g., Vulcans or Klingons) but are notably resilient and adaptable. Human DNA is compatible—with appropriate conditions/modifications—with several other humanoid species, and successful Human hybrids are known (including with Vulcans, Betazoids, and Klingons).",
    "society": "Human civilization is culturally diverse and highly adaptive, with wide variation across Earth and its colonies. Human society is repeatedly characterized by a strong drive to explore, innovate, and cooperate—traits that helped Humans become a major presence in Starfleet and Federation colonization efforts. Canon sources describe Human culture as having evolved to eliminate war, poverty, and disease by 2113. Politically, the 22nd century saw Earth’s unification under United Earth and the development of Earth‑origin institutions (including Starfleet’s precursors) that later integrated into Federation structures.",
    "capabilities": "Humans are often described as ‘average’ in raw physical and technological terms compared to many peers, but they excel in flexibility, innovation, and cross‑cultural collaboration. Humans display efficient thermoregulation (notably sweating) that supports endurance across varied climates. Limited evidence suggests some marginal extrasensory perception (e.g., rare telepaths), though such abilities are uncommon and historically controversial.",
    "relations": "Humans maintain close ties with Vulcans following first contact in 2063 and later partnered with Vulcan, Andoria, and Tellar in founding the United Federation of Planets in 2161. Across multiple eras, Humans and the Federation face major geopolitical and existential conflicts involving the Klingon Empire, Romulan Star Empire, the Borg Collective, and the Dominion. The Borg designate Humans as “Species 5618.” Human-led Starfleet exploration and diplomacy frequently place Humans at the center of first-contact events, alliances, and interstellar crises.",

They were among humanity’s earliest major interstellar contacts and became one of the Federation’s founding worlds.",
    "biology": "Typically stronger than humans and adapted to a hotter, drier environment. Copper-based blood (green). Adult Vulcans experience pon farr roughly every seven years, a biological mating drive that can become life-threatening if unresolved.",
    "society": "A philosophical culture rooted in Surak’s teachings, emphasizing logic, emotional control, and ethical restraint. Vulcan society often values privacy and personal discipline, and can appear aloof to outsiders.",
    "capabilities": "Telepathic techniques include the Vulcan mind meld. Many Vulcans practice martial disciplines; the Vulcan neck pinch is a well-known incapacitation technique.",
    "relations": "Vulcans maintain close ties with the Federation but have a complex relationship with their ancient offshoots, the Romulans. Their influence on Starfleet science, diplomacy, and ethics is extensive.",
